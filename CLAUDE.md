# Keymory — project guide

macOS menu-bar utility that remembers the keyboard input source (language/layout)
**per application** and restores it automatically when you switch apps.

**The one rule:** on app activation, set the input source last used in that app.
First-seen app → adopt the current source (or the configured *Default Language*).
A remembered source that is no longer installed/enabled → keep the current source
silently. Memory persists indefinitely (no eviction). Every app is auto-remembered.

- Repo: `github.com/mekh/keymory` · Bundle ID: `toxic0der.Keymory`
- Distribution: free, non-tracking, App Store (Utilities). Also runnable via direct build.

## Naming / layout

Renamed from **SmartInputSwitch** → **Keymory** (product, scheme, targets, folders,
bundle id — no trace of the old name should reappear).

- Xcode project: `Keymory.xcodeproj`, scheme `Keymory`, targets `Keymory` /
  `KeymoryTests` / `KeymoryUITests`.
- Source folders: `Keymory/`, `KeymoryTests/`, `KeymoryUITests/`.
- The **local checkout folder is still `smart-input-switch`** (kebab). The GitHub repo
  is `keymory`. Renaming the local folder is optional and not done.
- `objectVersion 77` file-system-synchronized groups: new `.swift` files under the
  target folders are picked up automatically — **no `project.pbxproj` edits needed** to
  add sources.

## Architecture (5 app files + 1 formatter, all MainActor)

- `Keymory/KeymoryApp.swift` — `@main` App with `NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`. The
  `AppDelegate` owns an AppKit **`NSStatusItem`** (menu bar) and the `SwitchController`.
  Uses `NSStatusItem` **not** SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` (MenuBarExtra did not reliably
  appear for a menu-bar-only app on this macOS). Menu is an `NSMenu` rebuilt in
  `menuNeedsUpdate`. `updateStatusAppearance()` renders the current-language indicator
  (flag or code) into a vertically-centred image; it is refreshed on the distributed TIS
  notification. `item.autosaveName = "KeymoryStatusItem"` persists the icon position.
  "Forget All" is tinted red via `attributedTitle` (NSColor.systemRed).
  "Track Pop-up Windows" renders `.mixed` while the Input Monitoring permission is
  missing; `menuNeedsUpdate` calls `refreshPopUpTracking()` so a grant made in Settings
  is picked up on the next menu open; on `.permissionRequired` the app opens
  `x-apple.systempreferences:...?Privacy_ListenEvent`.
- `Keymory/SwitchController.swift` — `@Observable @MainActor` state machine.
  `handleActivation` order: guard enabled/lock → ignore own bundle id → cancel
  `restoreTask` → **switch-away snapshot** (record outgoing app's current source, guarded
  by `lastRestore.verified`) → set frontmost → first-seen (adopt Default Language or
  current) / known (restore if differs). `handleSourceChange` records the user's manual
  switches, skipped when inside the **suppression window** (value + monotonic
  `ContinuousClock` deadline — not a boolean; the distributed notification arrives
  asynchronously). `restore()` = cancellable verify/retry loop (select → sleep 50ms →
  confirm, ×3) — this loop is the seam where CJKV handling would plug in. `start()` is
  idempotent (`started` guard), seeds the frontmost app at launch **without** restoring
  or recording, and handles screen lock/unlock. Pop-up tracking: `trackPopUps` is the
  persisted *intent* (may be true while the permission is missing); `handleEventTarget`
  accepts **any** event target as the new context — arbitrary apps' pop-ups work with no
  per-app list, incl. future apps — except transient system surfaces
  (`systemUIBundleIDs`: Dock, Control Center, Notification Center, WindowManager, …),
  which are ignored to avoid layout churn on every Dock/menu-bar interaction. Leaving a
  panel needs no special case: the next event targets the app underneath. Both
  directions reuse `handleActivation` wholesale (snapshot → restore → attribution).
  The tap runs iff enabled ∧ trackPopUps ∧ unlocked ∧ granted (`updateEventTap`).
  Known micro-edge: a ⌘-drag of a background window's title bar targets that app
  without moving keyboard focus, so one keystroke can land in its layout
  (self-corrects on the next event).
- `Keymory/InputSourceClient.swift` — protocol + `SystemInputSourceClient`; the **only**
  file that touches Carbon/TIS. `currentSourceID()` uses
  `TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource` (mode-level id, correct for IME sub-modes — never
  `...KeyboardLayoutInputSource`). `selectSource` queries `TISCreateInputSourceList` fresh
  each call (respects layouts added/removed at runtime), filtered by keyboard category +
  `IsSelectCapable` + `IsEnabled`. `currentSourceLanguageCode()` → primary language code.
- `Keymory/EventTapClient.swift` — protocol + `SystemEventTapClient`; the **only** file
  that touches CGEventTap. Listen-only tap at `kCGAnnotatedSessionEventTap` (mask:
  keyDown, leftMouseDown, flagsChanged) reading a single field per event —
  `kCGEventTargetUnixProcessID`, the pid the window server routes the event to. Key
  codes/characters are never inspected (privacy contract, stated in PRIVACY.md). Emits
  the bundle id only when the target *changes*; re-enables itself on
  `tapDisabledByTimeout`. Permission: `CGPreflightListenEventAccess` /
  `CGRequestListenEventAccess`; a fresh grant takes effect only after app relaunch
  (macOS offers "Quit & Reopen").
- `Keymory/MappingStore.swift` — persistence. `[String: AppEntry]` (bundleID → sourceID)
  JSON-encoded into one UserDefaults blob under key `"mappings.v1"`. `AppEntry` holds only
  `sourceID`. `record` skips the write when unchanged; there is **no `touch()`** — a bare
  app activation writes nothing (avoids per-Cmd-Tab write amplification). Backward-
  compatible decode (extra keys ignored).
- `Keymory/MenuBarLabel.swift` — pure, testable formatter. Language code → code
  ("EN"/"UA"/…) or flag emoji. `flagRegionByLanguage` maps language→region where they
  differ (`en`→US, `uk`→UA, `he`→IL, …); `codeOverrides` (`uk`→UA so it isn't confused
  with the UK). No RU examples are used anywhere in the project.
- Tests in `KeymoryTests/`: `MappingStoreTests`, `SwitchControllerTests`
  (with `MockInputSourceClient` and `MockEventTapClient`), `MenuBarLabelTests`.

## Build / test / run

Always build into a **`.noindex`** derived-data path (Spotlight ignores `*.noindex`;
it is gitignored) to avoid duplicate `Keymory.app` entries in Spotlight/Finder.

```sh
# Build (Release)
xcodebuild -project Keymory.xcodeproj -scheme Keymory -configuration Release \
  -derivedDataPath build.noindex build

# Unit tests
xcodebuild -project Keymory.xcodeproj -scheme Keymory -configuration Debug \
  -derivedDataPath build.noindex test -only-testing:KeymoryTests

# Install / run a dev build. NOT /Applications: that copy is the App Store
# install (root-owned, has _MASReceipt) — leave it alone. Launch by full path;
# a plain relaunch by bundle id (e.g. the system's "Quit & Reopen") resolves
# to the /Applications copy instead.
pkill -x Keymory
rm -rf ~/Applications/Keymory.app
cp -R build.noindex/Build/Products/Release/Keymory.app ~/Applications/
/usr/bin/open ~/Applications/Keymory.app
```

- **Never** build into the default DerivedData or an in-project `build/` — both are
  Spotlight-indexed and create duplicate app entries. Use `build.noindex`.
- Shell gotchas (zsh): `open` is aliased to `xdg-open` (missing) — use **`/usr/bin/open`**.
  Unquoted `for f in $VAR` does **not** word-split in zsh — use `while IFS= read -r f`.
- App is menu-bar-only (`LSUIElement`), `activationPolicy == .accessory`; it does **not**
  appear in Force Quit — that is expected.
- Verify a real change end-to-end by driving apps: `osascript -e 'tell application "X"
  to activate'` + set/read the input source, then check restore (Finder ↔ Calculator).
  iTerm2's hotkey window is scriptable too: `reveal/hide/toggle hotkey window` — but the
  event tap only reacts to real input events, so tap-path E2E needs a human typing.
- TCC during development: the Input Monitoring grant is keyed to bundle id + signing
  identity — it survives rebuilds (stable Apple Development cert) but does **not**
  transfer between the dev copy and the App Store copy. Reset:
  `tccutil reset ListenEvent toxic0der.Keymory`. **Never validate TCC behavior with
  terminal-launched scripts** — a script inherits the *terminal's* grants
  (responsible-process attribution) and proves nothing about the app; validate inside
  the installed sandboxed app (this false positive burned a previous attempt).

## Key build settings (`project.pbxproj`, app target Debug+Release)

`ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = YES`, `INFOPLIST_KEY_LSUIElement = YES`,
`INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName = Keymory`,
`INFOPLIST_KEY_LSApplicationCategoryType = "public.app-category.utilities"`,
`INFOPLIST_KEY_ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO`,
`GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES`, `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`,
`PRODUCT_NAME = Keymory` (test targets' `TEST_HOST` reference `Keymory.app`).
`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = RT7WS95PK2` must be set on **all three targets**: with it only on
the app target, the CLI test run fails to load `KeymoryTests.xctest` ("mapping process
and mapped file have different Team IDs").

## Critical technical facts (verified empirically)

- **App Sandbox is ON and everything works under it**: `TISSelectInputSource`,
  `NSWorkspace` activation notifications, `SMAppService`, `UserDefaults`, and the
  distributed notification `com.apple.Carbon.TISNotifySelectedKeyboardInputSourceChanged`
  (via `DistributedNotificationCenter`) are all delivered under sandbox. No polling and no
  Darwin notify center needed. (An earlier belief that sandbox blocks
  `TISSelectInputSource` or the notification was WRONG.)
- **Sandboxed prefs live in the container**, not `~/Library/Preferences`:
  `~/Library/Containers/toxic0der.Keymory/Data/Library/Preferences/toxic0der.Keymory.plist`.
- **Do NOT verify a UserDefaults write or notification delivery by reading the plist file
  directly** — `cfprefsd` caches it and the on-disk file can be stale (this produced a
  false "notification blocked" result). Use a file append from the handler, or the live UI.
- **Sandbox blocks the Accessibility API on other apps entirely** — no grant (manual or
  prompted) changes that; `AXIsProcessTrusted()` stays false in-sandbox (Apple DTS:
  developer.apple.com/forums threads 749494, 805556, 810677). Do not revisit an AX-based
  design while the sandbox stays on. MAS window managers that look like counterexamples
  (Magnet, BetterSnapTool) are pre-2012 grandfathered non-sandboxed apps.
- **`CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` is useless here on macOS 26**: without Screen Recording
  it returns only the caller's own windows (verified on 26.5.2 — not even the Dock).
  Window-presence heuristics are dead; do not revisit.
- **The shipped mechanism**: listen-only `CGEventTap` at `kCGAnnotatedSessionEventTap`
  under **Input Monitoring** — explicitly sandbox- and MAS-legal (Apple DTS/Quinn,
  thread 707680). `kCGEventTargetUnixProcessID` is populated and correct: typing into
  the iTerm hotkey panel targets iTerm while `frontmostApplication` still reports the
  previous app (verified in-app, 2026-07-18).
- **Carbon hotkeys are invisible to the tap** (consumed before the tap point): iTerm's
  F12 and Spotlight's ⌘Space never arrive as keyDown. Consequence: switching happens on
  the first real keystroke/click into the panel (first-char-in-old-layout caveat). But
  the trailing `flagsChanged` of a *modifier-based* hotkey (releasing ⌘ after ⌘Space) IS
  delivered and already targets the panel — that's why flagsChanged is in the tap mask
  and why modifier hotkeys switch before the first character.
- iTerm2 hotkey-window internals (source-verified): the non-activating case is
  `iTermHotkeyWindowTypeFloatingPanel` = profile "Floating window" ON **and**
  Window ▸ Space = "All Spaces" → `NSWindowStyleMaskNonactivatingPanel`, activation
  deliberately skipped ("Exclude from Dock" is only the UI precondition). iTerm's own
  "Force keyboard" feature breaks for that panel the same way (keyed on
  `didBecomeActive`).
- Image tooling (CoreGraphics): in a `CGBitmapContext` here, **memory row 0 = top**
  (`memory_row == top-based y`) — do not flip when reading raw pixels. Drawing ops
  (`ctx.draw`/`ctx.fill`) still use the bottom-left coordinate system.
- No network, no cryptography, no third-party dependencies.

## Conventions

- **Git (from the `git-flow` skill):** never `git commit`/`git push` (or merge/rebase/
  force-push/open a PR) without the user's **explicit per-request** permission — staging
  and read-only git are fine. **Never add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer.** History was
  squashed to a single "Initial commit"; new work goes on top.
- Gitignored: `build/`, `build.noindex/`, `DerivedData/`, `xcuserdata/`, `.DS_Store`.
- Documentation and code comments are **English only**.

## Distribution assets

- App icon (K + memory-loop mark) generated natively via CoreGraphics; iconset in
  `Keymory/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`.
- Marketing SVGs in `docs/` (hero, menu, how-it-works, flags). App Store screenshots
  (2560×1600) in `docs/appstore/` — 3 SVG posters + 3 real-UI captures.
- Privacy policy: `PRIVACY.md` → `https://github.com/mekh/keymory/blob/main/PRIVACY.md`
  (no data collected; documents the optional Input Monitoring permission and its
  target-pid-only contract).

## Out of scope / known limitations (see README)

- **CJKV** (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Vietnamese IMEs) — not the focus; the verify/retry
  loop in `restore()` is where it would be added.
- Electron/terminal/Java apps that cache the input source per TSM document may ignore an
  otherwise-successful system switch.
- Non-activating panels of **any** app (iTerm hotkey window, Spotlight, Raycast,
  1Password Quick Access, …) are covered by the
  **optional "Track Pop-up Windows"** mode (Input Monitoring). Residual edge: plain-key
  hotkeys (F12) are invisible, so the first character right after opening the panel may
  land in the previous layout; a click into the panel, or a modifier-based hotkey
  (⌥F12), switches before typing. With the option off, the old behavior applies (change
  attributed to the previous app; self-corrects on next use).
